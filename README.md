# The-C
Responsive website in AngularJS

a. Created the following layout in HTML/CSS: (it’s a “C” for CircleUp with a green “glint” in the corner)

White boxes are 100px by 100px, green box is 24px by 24px. 
b. Wrote a jQuery / javascript so that clicking the large white boxes turns them blue (ignoring the little green box). After the last one has been clicked, the green box turns red and the blue boxes should start “undoing” their blue coloring, in the reverse order that they were clicked, separated by 1 second.  Nothing responds to clicks during this period. After they are all undone, the little red box should become green again and everything should be back to its initial state.
It should behave like in this video:
